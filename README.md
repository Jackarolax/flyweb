# flyweb
FlyWeb is a startup focusing on disrupting the last mile delivery market.

currently the project is in the early prototype phase.

## Progress

Building a delivery network requires a drone that can carry a payload.
That is why my first steps were to build a rather large drone and get to know the nature of x-class UAVs.

This was the first approach at building a Quadcopter with a 10 inch diameter.

Here you can see the drone flying

</p>

I also set myself up to build a Li-ion pack for higher density in energy capacity
(fpv drones are usually flown with Lipo cells that excell in high discharge rates)

This is how I built an 18650 6s2p 5000mah 40A battery

and I also built a 21700 6s2p 8000mah 80A battery
